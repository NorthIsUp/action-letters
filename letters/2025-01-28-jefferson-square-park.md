I am writing to express urgent concerns regarding the deteriorating conditions at Jefferson Square Park and the immediate surrounding area. Our community is experiencing serious safety and public health issues that require immediate attention and a comprehensive solutionâ€”not simply displacing these problems to other neighborhoods.

Jefferson Square Park is surrounded by many schools and residential buildings. Sacred Heart and Millennium schools are located directly on the park and Rosa Parks Elementary is just a block away. Margaret S. Hayward Playground has many after school care activities and youth sports programs like soccer, soft ball, and skateboarding lessons. Established in 1850 it is one of San Francisco's oldest public spaces and has been a vital community gathering place for over 174 years. This historic park served as a refugee camp after the 1906 earthquake and was later immortalized in Alfred Hitchcock's classic film "Vertigo" giving it an earned spot in San Francisco's cultural heritage.

The current situation presents immediate safety risks to residents, students, and park users. Residents have observed the following activities and conditions:

- Organized drug trafficking operations during nighttime hours
- Multiple break-ins and burglaries targeting nearby residences
- Sidewalk fires and attempted arson of residential buildings
- Groups blocking emergency exits and main entrances to buildings
- Ongoing package theft from residential buildings
- Discarded medical waste throughout the park
- Human waste contamination
- Excessive accumulation of trash and debris
- Unsanitary conditions affecting park usability

The current conditions have effectively rendered this public space unusable for its intended purpose and create unacceptable risks for our community. We urgently request:

- A detailed action plan addressing these issues comprehensively
- Timeline for implementation of safety measures
- Coordination between SFPD, Recreation and Parks, and social services
- Regular community updates on progress
- Long-term strategies to prevent recurrence

We recognize these challenges require a balanced approach that addresses both immediate safety concerns and underlying causes. However, the current situation is untenable and demands urgent action.

Please provide information about your planned response to these issues. Our community stands ready to engage constructively in developing and implementing solutions.
